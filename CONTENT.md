## ABOUT PAGE

### Philosophy
**Headline**: We Build Real Products

Most development shops sell engineering hours. We deliver working systems that create value.

We're not a staffing agency. We're not a design studio. We're a product development company that happens to write exceptional code and design elegant interfaces.

### How We Work

**1. Discovery & Architecture (Week 1-2)**
We start by understanding your actual problem, not your feature request. Technical feasibility analysis, architecture design, and effort estimation with clear trade-offs documented.

**2. Iterative Development (Weeks 3+)**
Weekly deployed increments. You see progress in production, not just on staging. Continuous integration, automated testing, and real user feedback loops.

**3. Quality Assurance**
Code review on every PR. End-to-end test coverage. Performance profiling. Security audits. We ship with confidence, not crossed fingers.

**4. Launch & Support**
Deployment runbooks. Monitoring dashboards. Incident response protocols. We stay involved until your system is stable and your team is trained.

### Core Principles

**Technical Excellence**
We stay at the edge of the industry. New frameworks, new patterns, new tools—evaluated rigorously and adopted strategically.

**Radical Clarity**
No bullshit. No padding. No theater. Clear communication about what's possible, what's expensive, and what's worth building.

**Long-Term Thinking**
We write code that outlasts the initial project. Documented decisions, maintainable architecture, extensible patterns.

**Outcome Accountability**
We measure success by shipped products and user outcomes, not story points or sprint velocity.
