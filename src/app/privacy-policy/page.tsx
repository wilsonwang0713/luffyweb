            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Data We Collect About You</h2>
            <p>
              Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).

              We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together as follows:

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 my-4">
              <li>Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.</li>
              <li>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.</li>
              <li>Where we need to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>

            <p>
              We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
